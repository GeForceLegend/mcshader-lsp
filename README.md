# vscode-mc-shader

This is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It (will) provide linting, syntax highlighting, warnings for unused uniforms, some cool DRAWBUFFERS stuff, auto-complete options and whatever else I think of for developing Minecraft GLSL Shaders using [Optifine](http://optifine.net).

## Features

So far? Nothing

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code of course
- The [Shader languages support for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader) extension
- The [OpenGL / OpenGL ES Reference Compiler](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/) (for convenience, put it in your PATH)

## Extension Settings

- `mcglsl.glslangValidatorPath` : The path to the glslangValidator executable

## Known Issues

It doesn't work yet I guess...

## Release Notes

### X.X.X
I added code. It does nothing really.
